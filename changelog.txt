This file contains changes specific to the scripts repo. See docs/changelog.txt
in the dfhack repo for a full description, or
https://docs.dfhack.org/en/latest/docs/dev/Documentation.html#building-the-changelogs

NOTE: currently, gen_changelog.py expects a "Future" section to exist at the
top of this file (even if no changes are listed under it), or you will get a
"Entry without section" error. Also, to maintain proper sorting in the generated
changelogs when making a new release, docs/changelog.txt in the dfhack repo must
have the new release listed in the right place, even if no changes were made in
that repo.

- `gui/control-panel`: removed `autolabor` from the ``Fort`` and ``Autostart`` tabs. The tool does not function correctly with the new labor types, and is causing confusion.

- `gui/gm-editor`: for fields with primitive types, change from click to edit to click to select, double-click to edit. this should help prevent accidental modifications to the data and make hotkeys easier to use (since you have to click on a data item to use a hotkey on it)
